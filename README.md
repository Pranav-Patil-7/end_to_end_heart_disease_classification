Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
I have used various Python-based Machine Learning and Data Science Libraries for building machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on thier medical attributes.

Problem Definition
In a Statement,

Given Clinical Parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have Heart Disease?

Data
The original data came from the Cleavland database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

Evaluation
If I can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, Project will be Pursued.
